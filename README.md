# Topic-Modelling

If we have large unstructred text data, it's very diffcult to understand the content/context as it takes a lot of effort and time to go through the content. Hence there is a need of technique which can help us to find out key topics discussed in text wihout even reading it. This technique is know as Topic Modelling. 

A lot of research has been done on Topic Modelling. Currently latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) is state of the art algorithm to find hidden topics in text data. We have used Gensim which is one of the most popular library for topic modelling in python.

Using LDA, We tried to find out key topic discussed in New york times dataset. To visuzalize topic word distribution we have used pyLDAvis, word cloud and co-occurence graphs.

please refer the notebook for more details.
